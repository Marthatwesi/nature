    <h1>About Nature</h1
    <p>The beauty of <em>nature</em> can have a profound effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner, whether it results in disbelief in its very existence as Emerson notes, or feelings such as awe, wonder, or amazement.</p>
<p>“God is the most beautiful, and beauty is the expression of God. If you can't appreciate beauty in the world how can you understand God?”
― Amit Ray</p>
